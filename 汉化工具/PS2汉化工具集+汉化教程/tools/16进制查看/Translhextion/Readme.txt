Whats New in 1.5?
- By request, a new feature called "Thingy IME" allows you to directly enter dynamically table-encoded text into a file
   + Now you don't have to dump a script to a file or to the screen to edit it
   + You can enter text in insert or overwrite modes
   + Text you enter is encoded on the fly as you type it
   + Load and activate a table and press <ENTER> and you're ready to go
- After dumping a Japanese script you will now be given the option to merge punctuation characters with the characters they modify which produces a more Thingy-like script
- By request, added the ability to hide/show the hex pane for easy script viewing
   + This mode does not allow editing
- Now any bytes that get changed are displayed in a different, user-selectable color so they are easy to see
- Extended Thingy Table functionality with ' ^ ' which you can use to highlight specific bytes in a user-selectable highlight color
   + Syntax is as follows: ^xx
- Changed "Color Settings" dialog to accommodate new colors
- Fixed a majority of the selection color bugs
   + Selected text color now works as it should
- Translhextion will now attempt to automatically install the included Japanese font when it runs for the first time
- A number of aesthetic changes have been made
- The documentation has not only been updated but is now in HTML Help format thanks to Kitsune Sniper
